evaluate.py

This module provides the evaluate function which will call functions to apply all appropriate attacks, 
and determine a risk evaluation based on them (low, medium, high.)

    # Call other modules to perform attacks and receive accuracy
    
    # Algorithm to weigh and calculate differnt accuracy scores, to give a final risk evaluation 
    risk_eval = "LOW"
