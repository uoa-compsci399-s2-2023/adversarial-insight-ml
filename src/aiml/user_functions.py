User Functions Module

This module provides a collection of user-friendly functions to simplify the usage of AIML. 
It serves as an entry point for users looking to perform common tasks in a streamlined way.

Functions:  
    - `load_data(file_path)`: Load data from a file and return it in a structured format.
    - `preprocess_data(data)`: Perform data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering.
    - `train_model(data, target)`: Train a machine learning model on the provided data.
    - `evaluate_model(model, test_data, test_target)`: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
    - `generate_predictions(model, new_data)`: Generate predictions using a trained model.

Usage Example:
    >>> import your_package.user_functions as uf
    >>> data = uf.load_data('data.csv')
    >>> data = uf.preprocess_data(data)
    >>> model = uf.train_model(data, target='label')
    >>> test_data = uf.load_data('test_data.csv')
    >>> predictions = uf.generate_predictions(model, test_data)

For more detailed information on each function and its parameters, please refer to the documentation for individual functions within this module.
