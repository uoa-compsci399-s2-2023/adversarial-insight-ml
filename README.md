PROJECT 22:
Why Does the Machine Lie? Understanding Adversarial Attacks and Their Impact on Machine Learning Models 

CLIENT:
Luke Chang xcha011@aucklanduni.ac.nz

PROJECT DELIVERABLES: 
1. Benchmarking existing Adversarial Attacks.
2. Provide a Python package to evaluate the robustness of a given neural network model against state-of-the-art adversarial
   attacks.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to provide a deep understanding of adversarial attacks and their impact on machine learning models.
By leveraging their knowledge of machine learning and basic neural network models, students will develop a Python toolkit 
that evaluates the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks.

# Automated Pipeline Toolkit for Security Evaluation of Machine Learning Models and Their System

This project is a Python package designed to run through PyPi, that evaluates the robustness of machine learning models in image processing against adversarial attacks. The final program in the package should automatically test potential adversarial attacks against each given machine learning model and give users accurate, efficient and robust feedback through several benchmarks we develop. Furthermore, the package should be designed to allow non-technical users to use it as well.
