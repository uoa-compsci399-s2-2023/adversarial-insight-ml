PROJECT 22:
Why Does the Machine Lie? Understanding Adversarial Attacks and Their Impact on Machine Learning Models 

CLIENT:
Luke Chang xcha011@aucklanduni.ac.nz

PROJECT DELIVERABLES: 
1. Benchmarking existing Adversarial Attacks.
2. Provide a Python package to evaluate the robustness of a given neural network model against state-of-the-art adversarial
   attacks.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to provide a deep understanding of adversarial attacks and their impact on machine learning models.
By leveraging their knowledge of machine learning and basic neural network models, students will develop a Python toolkit 
that evaluates the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks.
